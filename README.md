This repo contains the code and data supporting the paper on the minimum
response rate of polls in the City of Toronto

# Abstract

Polls are a widely used and effective way for administrative divisions to
determine the general opinion of residents and businesses on various topics.
We obtain the polls conducted by the city of Toronto broken down based
on the type of application and analyze it using two graphs and a table.
The data shows a consistent trend for parking-related polls to meet the
required engagement rate, while the opposite is seen for traffic calming
applications. The findings suggest a change in percentage for the number
of returned ballots required for polls regarding traffic calming.
